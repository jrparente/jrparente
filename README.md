# Hi there! I'm Joana and I'm a web developer 👋

I have been making a transition from business management and sales to web development since the end of 2022. My current skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
 
 I'm excited to share my projects on GitHub and continue growing as a developer. 
 
 I believe in continuous learning and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and I'm eager to work on new and challenging projects

## What I'm up to 🔭

- 👩‍💻 **Currently working on**: Personal projects to practice the skills I'm learning and add to my portfolio.

- 📚 **Currently learning**: Applying the concepts I've learned in my FrontEnd Developer Career Path course to real-world projects. Deepening my understanding of design patterns and best practices.

- 🤝 **Looking to collaborate on**: Open-source projects that help me grow as a developer and contribute positively to the community.

- 🌟 **Goals for 2023**: Re-launch my web applications with improved functionality and modern design. Continue to improve my skills and knowledge as a full-stack developer.

## Current Projects 🚀

These are projects that I'm constantly working on and trying to improve, which were designed and coded by me, without the help of any tutorials or courses:

- Personal Project: Developing a digital media brand which empowers women to make informed decisions about their well-being and financial stability, through articles, online courses, and a newsletter.

- Personal Project: [joanaramosparente.pt](https://github.com/jrparente/joanaramosparente) - Working on revamping my portfolio with a modern and clean design using React.

- Personal Project: [Simple Dinner Generator](https://github.com/jrparente/app-simple-dinners) - An application to generate simple dinner ideas and shopping lists for the week ahead.
