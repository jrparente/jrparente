# Hi there! I'm Joana and I'm a web developer 👋

 I come from a background in hotel management and sales, but decided to pursue my passion for technology and make a career change in 2022. I've been working hard to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS and now I'm diving into back-end development with NodeJs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Express. 
 
 I'm excited to share my projects on GitHub and continue growing as a developer. 
 
 I believe in continuous learning and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and I'm eager to work on new and challenging projects

## What I'm up to:

- [ ] 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and React

- [ ] 💻 I’m working on projects to add to my portfolio

- [ ] 🤔 Looking for an internship, to gain some real-world experience

## Current Projects:

These are projects that I'm constantly working on and trying to improve, which were designed and coded by me, without the help of any tutorials or courses:

[joanaramosparente.pt](https://github.com/jrparente/joanaramosparente) - I'm rebuilding my portfolio to modernize and simplify the code structure with React

[Simple Dinner Generator](https://github.com/jrparente/app-simple-dinners) - I am working on an app that will help me generate simple dinner ideas for the week ahead, and get me a shopping list for the those dinners.
