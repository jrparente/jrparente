## About Me

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in digital strategy and operations**.

Before moving fully into development, I spent over 10 years working in account management, entrepreneurship, and growth-focused roles. That experience shapes how I build software today: I care about clarity, performance, and whether something actually solves a real problem, not just whether the code is clever.

I’m an **MIT xPRO Certified Full-Stack Developer**. Over the past few years, I’ve been building and maintaining production systems for real businesses, including the digital and operational infrastructure of a tourism company that grew its revenue by **400%** during that period.

I’m comfortable owning a project end to end, from shaping the solution and data model to shipping and maintaining it. I like clean architectures, predictable systems, and code that someone else can pick up without hating me six months later.

### What I usually work with

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **CMS:** Sanity (GROQ, content modelling, multilingual content)  
- **Backend (when needed):** Next.js API routes / server actions, REST-style endpoints, webhooks (for payments + emails)  
- **Data:** Supabase (when it fits the project)  
- **Tooling & delivery:** Vercel, GitHub, performance-first builds (image optimisation, caching, clean component structure)

### What I’m interested in

- Building **solid, long-lasting digital products**
- Systems that scale without becoming fragile or overcomplicated
- Projects where technical decisions actually matter to the business

### Work & collaboration

I’m interested in partnering with businesses to architect **growth-focused digital products and automated operational systems**.

I’m open to consulting, developer roles, or long-term collaborations, especially on projects where technical decisions directly support scale, clarity, and day-to-day operations.
