# Hi there, I'm Joana 👋

I am a self-guided ~~wannabe~~ 	*learner* developer, based in Portugal.

## What I'm up to:

- [ ] 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and React

- [ ] 💻 I’m working on projects to add to my portfolio

- [ ] 🤔 Looking for an internship, to gain some real-world experience

## Current Projects:

[joanaramosparente.pt](https://github.com/jrparente/joanaramosparente) - I'm rebuilding my portfolio to modernize and simplify the code structure with React

[Simple Dinner Generator](https://github.com/jrparente/app-simple-dinners) - I am working on an app that will help me generate simple dinner ideas for the week ahead, and get me a shopping list for the those dinners.
