# Hi there! I'm Joana and I'm a web developer 👋

 I come from a background in hotel management and sales, but decided to pursue my passion for technology and make a career change in 2022. I've been working hard to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS and now I'm diving into back-end development with NodeJs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Express. 
 
 I'm excited to share my projects on GitHub and continue growing as a developer. 
 
 I believe in continuous learning and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and I'm eager to work on new and challenging projects

## What I'm up to 🔭

- 👩‍💻 **Currently working on**: Building a full-stack e-commerce website using React, Node.js, and MongoDB

- 📚 **Currently learning**: React and Node.js, as well as exploring different design patterns and best practices.

- 🤝 **Looking to collaborate on**: Open-source projects that align with my interests and allow me to contribute to the community.

- 🌟 **Goals for 2023**: Build and launch a web application that makes a positive impact and continue to improve my skills and knowledge as a full stack developer.

## Current Projects 🚀

These are projects that I'm constantly working on and trying to improve, which were designed and coded by me, without the help of any tutorials or courses:

- Client Project: Creating a blog and portfolio website for a client, to display a portfolio, services and share insights in her industry.

- Personal Project: Developing a digital media brand which empowers women to make informed decisions about their well-being and financial stability, through articles, online courses, and a newsletter.

- Personal Project: [joanaramosparente.pt](https://github.com/jrparente/joanaramosparente) - I'm rebuilding my portfolio to modernize and simplify the code structure with React

- Personal Project: [Simple Dinner Generator](https://github.com/jrparente/app-simple-dinners) - I am working on an app that will help me generate simple dinner ideas for the week ahead, and get me a shopping list for the those dinners.
