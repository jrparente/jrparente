# Hi there! I'm Joana and I'm a web developer 👋

I have been making a transition from business management and sales to web development since the end of 2022. My current skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 
 
I'm excited to share my projects on GitHub and continue growing as a developer. 
 
I believe in continuous learning and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and I'm eager to work on new and challenging projects

## What I'm up to 🔭

- 👩‍💻 **Currently working on**: Personal projects to practice the skills I'm learning and add to my portfolio.

- 📚 **Currently learning**: Enrolled in **MIT xPRO - Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN**, ending in August 2024. The program covers foundational web development skills, dives into front-end expertise with React, and solidifies back-end proficiency with MongoDB, ExpressJS, and NodeJS.

- 🤝 **Looking to collaborate on**: Open-source projects that help me grow as a developer and contribute positively to the community.

- 🌟 **Goals for 2024**: Secure a fulfilling tech role (*Curious about my skills? Check out my [resume](https://joana-parente.netlify.app/Joana_Parente_Resume.pdf)!*), engage in collaborative large-scale projects, explore new languages, and expand my skills within a professional development setting.

## Current Projects 🚀

These are projects that I'm constantly working on and trying to improve, which were designed and coded by me, without the help of any tutorials or courses:

- **Personal Project: [Simple Dinners Generator](https://github.com/jrparente/app-simple-dinners)** - My first solo project, Simple Dinners Generator is undergoing a transformation into a full-stack MERN app. I'm dedicated to enhancing both its functionality and the user experience, putting my newfound skills to the test.

  - *Current Focus:*
    - Transitioning to a full stack with MERN.
    - Elevating the overall UX and UI for a more seamless user interaction.
  
- **Personal Project: [AI Travel Planner](https://ai-travel-agent.netlify.app/)** - This presents an exciting challenge. While it functions flawlessly in development, there are hiccups in production due to Vercel's API call timeout. I'm committed to resolving these issues and, of course, refining the user experience and interface.

  - *Current Challenges:*
    - Addressing production issues related to Vercel's API call timeout.
    - Ongoing efforts to enhance both UX and UI for a delightful user journey.
